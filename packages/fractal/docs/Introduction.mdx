![Fractal Design System](/images/cover_fractal.png)

Fractal is [Snowball's](https://snowball.xyz) design system.

It is a collection of assets, UI components and guidelines that are used to
build products, apps, marketing contents and documentations.

## üß± Foundations

The base reference for Fractal is the
[Figma
project](https://www.figma.com/file/u70V0ocCmDeYMAAPf9Xfqa/‚ùÑ%EF%B8%8F-Fractal-Design-System).  
All tokens created in Figma are then transformed in the
[`design-tokens`
package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snowball-tech/design-tokens).  
Finally, those design token are the used inside of the Fractal Design System.
